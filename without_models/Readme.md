Predictive Modeling Using Basic Statistical Methods
Classification Task:

predicting survival on the Titanic dataset without using machine learning models. Here's how I approached it:

    Method: Analyzed data using mean, median, and mode without complex models.
    Results: Achieved an accuracy above 85% in classification using gender and gender-class combinations.

Regression Task:

regression for predicting sales on the BigMart dataset using basic statistical techniques:

    Method: Predicted sales using mean values based on outlet type, establishment year, and location type.
    Results: Achieved competitive Mean Absolute Error (MAE) scores compared to more complex regression models.

Insights:

These exercises demonstrate the power of foundational data analysis techniques in making informed predictions. By understanding data relationships and leveraging basic statistical measures effectively, meaningful insights can be gained without relying on complex machine learning algorithms.
